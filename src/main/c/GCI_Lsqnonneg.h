/**
   This function solves the non-negative least squares problem.
   Minimise |Ax-b| subject to x >= 0 (where |v| is the 2-norm of the
   vector v).
   !!! NB: A and B will both be modified unless preserve is non-zero (see below).

   \param[in] A An m x n matrix, in the form double A[n][m], so the columns of A are A[0], A[1], ..., A[n-1]
   \param[in] b The m-vector
   \param[out] x The solution
   \param[in]  m The size of the 'm' dimensions of A
   \param[in]  n The size of the 'n' dimensions of A
   \param[in]  preserve Copy A and b before solving the problem so they are not modified
   \param[out] rnorm The value of |Ax-b| with the
                determined x if the function was successful or if the
                iteration count was exceeded.  This can be NULL.
   \param[out] lambda An n-vector which will contain the dual vector
                 on completion (that is, the Lagrange multipliers).
                 This can be NULL.
   \return The return value will be 0 on success, and negative if
                a problem occurred:
               - -1: m > MAX_EQNS or m <= 0
               - -2: n > MAX_VARS or n <= 0
               - -3: iteration count exceeded: more than 3*n iterations
                    performed
               - -4: memory allocation problems
